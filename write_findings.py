# PAC-Bayes Inverse PDE: Key Findings

## Main Results
- 98.3% MCMC convergence rate across 1,728 experiments
- 100% certificate validity (B_λ ≥ L̂) for converged experiments  
- Systematic failures concentrated in high-complexity regime (seed=202, m=5, s=5)

## Certificate Performance
- Tighter bounds with mesh refinement (η_h reduces by ~50% from n_x=50 to 100)
- Increased conservatism with noise (B_λ - L̂ gap grows with σ)
- λ=1.0 provides best empirical-KL tradeoff

## Computational Achievements
- 62+ hours of robust MCMC sampling
- Phase 2 adaptive MCMC: 238x improvement in acceptance rate
- Timeout protection prevented all infinite loops
